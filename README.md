# email-intent-classifier
This project aims to classify emails related to real estate and legal business contexts into one of eight predefined intent categories. The classification system uses a hybrid approach that combines Sentence-BERT embeddings and a Logistic Regression classifier, deployed via a Flask API with an interactive web-based user interface.
